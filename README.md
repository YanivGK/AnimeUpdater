Allow you to get notifications for your favorite animes.
 I created this script in order to help myself get notifictions when my favorite animes are up.
 I find myself checking several times a day my animes sites, and decided to write a script that do it for me.
 Glad to share it online, and might help to others.
 
 To use the script you need 4 things:
 1. Account on MAL, you can create one here: http://myanimelist.net/
 2. Python on your computer, with the Selenium module installed on it.
 3. Firefox installed
 4. And a reliable internet conncetion :)
 
 To start the running the script:
 1. Open the Selenium_Firefox.py using notepad.
 2. Edit at the right places: MY_USERNAME, MY_PASSWORD, MY_MAL_PAGE
 3. Open CMD
 4. Write command: python the_location_of_this_script
    For example: python C:/Selenium_Firefox.py
  
Hope it help you as it help me,
Comment for feedback.
